# gall.vim

effectively a clone of [https://github.com/dylanaraps](dylanarap's) [https://github.com/dylanaraps/wal.vim](wal.vim).

gall.vim will diverge with time.

## edits so far

+ slightly reorganised colourscheme file
+ heavily edited the lightline theme
+ removed airline support because i don't use it, and i don't want to update it to match lightline.
