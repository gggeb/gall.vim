# gall.vim

effectively a clone of [dylanarap's](https://github.com/dylanaraps) [wal.vim](https://github.com/dylanaraps/wal.vim)

gall.vim will diverge with time.

## edits so far

+ slightly reorganised colourscheme file
+ heavily edited the lightline theme
+ removed airline support because i don't use it, and i don't want to update it to match lightline.
